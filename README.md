This repo contains code which I wrote while following along with the
extremely excellent and freely available
[Getting Started with Redux lessons on egghead.io](https://egghead.io/series/getting-started-with-redux)

The code itself is not standalone - it is written on JSBIN. So, to date, you
can't clone the repo and build/run it. Instead, copy the contents of the
following files to the corresponding section on a JSBIN project.

Note: javascript section should be set to ES6/babel

- index.html -> jsbin html section
- style.css -> jsbin css section
- todoList.js -> json javascript section
